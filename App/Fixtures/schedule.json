His songs reflect a peregrine of life shared by so many on the continent of Africa, but few are able to express their experiences in a way that captures the ear so universally and directly. Orphaned at an early age, he left Goma in the Eastern DRC after finishing high school and headed for Durban in 2007 with the sole purpose of pursuing a professional music career. It was a new world for a small town boy, having to learn English in a short space of time.",
